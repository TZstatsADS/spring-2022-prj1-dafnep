### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Fall 2021

+ Projec title: A "data story" on the history of philosophy
+ This project is conducted by Dafne Pelagia Papaefthymiou

+ Project summary: In this blog we are going to talk about the story of philosophy. When were philosophical texts first introduced and how did this science evolved through the years? How do the different philosophical schools influenced each other and do they share common points of interest? We attempt to answer those questions through a thorough data analysis in a large dataset of philosophical texts.
