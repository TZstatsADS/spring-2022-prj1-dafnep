# ADS Project 1:  R Notebook on the history of philosophy

### Code dev/lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions and computation codes for your data analysis. 

Although the code for our analysis is included in our final notebook, we thought that our data preprocessing analysis could be usefull as a stand alone script in any document analysis task. We thus include it in this folder so that interested users can download it and use it for their own projects.
